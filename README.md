# 🔐 Securing a Vulnerable Web Application using OWASP Juice Shop
*A Practical Web Application Security Assessment and Hardening Project*

---

## 📌 Quick Summary
This project demonstrates a practical web application security assessment conducted on OWASP Juice Shop in a controlled lab environment. The objective was to identify common web vulnerabilities, analyze their impact, and apply or propose appropriate security mitigations aligned with OWASP Top 10 standards.

---

## 📖 Introduction
Web application security is a critical domain in cybersecurity, as many real-world breaches occur due to insecure coding practices, broken authentication mechanisms, improper access control, and security misconfigurations.

OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally vulnerable web application developed to showcase common security flaws. This project simulates a real-world penetration testing and hardening workflow in a safe and ethical environment for educational purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand common web application vulnerabilities  
- Deploy OWASP Juice Shop in a controlled lab environment  
- Perform ethical vulnerability assessment  
- Map findings to OWASP Top 10  
- Apply or propose security mitigations  
- Validate fixes through retesting  
- Document findings in a structured manner  

---

## 🛑 Vulnerabilities Identified
- SQL Injection  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Broken Authentication  
- Broken Access Control  
- Security Misconfiguration  
- Sensitive Data Exposure  

All vulnerabilities were mapped to the **OWASP Top 10** framework.

## 📊 Findings Summary

| Vulnerability | OWASP Top 10 Category | Impact | Mitigation | Retest Status |
|--------------|----------------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| SQL Injection | Injection | Data compromise | Parameterized queries | Not reproducible |
| XSS | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Script execution | Input sanitization, CSP | Blocked |
| Broken Auth | Identification and Authentication Failures | Account takeover | Strong auth policies | Improved |
| Access Control | Broken Access Control | Privilege escalation | RBAC enforcement | Prevented |
| Misconfiguration | Security Misconfiguration | Info disclosure | Hardening configs | Reduced |
| Data Exposure | Sensitive Data Exposure / Cryptographic Failures | Data leakage | HTTPS, secrets mgmt | Secured |

## 🛠️ Security Fixes & Mitigations

### SQL Injection
- **Fix:** Server-side validation and prepared statements  
- **Result:** Injection attempts blocked  

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Fix:** Output encoding and Content Security Policy  
- **Result:** Script execution prevented  

### Broken Authentication
- **Fix:** Strong password policy and secure sessions  
- **Result:** Reduced unauthorized access  

### Broken Access Control
- **Fix:** Role-based access control  
- **Result:** Unauthorized access prevented  

### Security Misconfiguration
- **Fix:** Disabled debug mode, hardened configurations  
- **Result:** Reduced information leakage  

### Sensitive Data Exposure
- **Fix:** HTTPS enforcement and credential protection  
- **Result:** Improved confidentiality  

Some mitigations were applied at configuration level, while others are proposed as secure design recommendations based on OWASP best practices.

---

## 🔁 Validation & Retesting
All identified vulnerabilities were re-tested after mitigation. Previously exploitable issues were no longer reproducible or were significantly reduced.

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in web application security testing  
- Improved understanding of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities  
- Learned structured vulnerability assessment and reporting  
- Practiced ethical security testing in a controlled environment
